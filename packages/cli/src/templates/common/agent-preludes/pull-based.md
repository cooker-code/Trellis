## Required: Load Trellis Context First

This platform does NOT auto-inject task context via hook. Before doing anything else, you MUST load context yourself.

### Step 1: Find the active task path

Try in order — stop at the first one that yields a task path:

1. **Look at the dispatch prompt** you received from the main agent. If its first line is `Active task: <path>` (e.g. `Active task: .trellis/tasks/04-17-foo`), use that path. The main agent is required to include this line on class-2 platforms.
2. **Run** `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py current --source` and read the `Current task:` line.
3. **If both fail** (no `Active task:` line in the prompt and `task.py current` returns no task), ask the user which task to work on; do NOT guess.

### Step 2: Load task context from the resolved path

1. Read `<task-path>/{{JSONL_FILE}}` — JSONL list of spec/research files relevant to this agent.
2. For each entry in the JSONL, Read its `file` path — these are the specs and research notes you must follow.
   **Skip rows without a `"file"` field** (e.g. `{"_example": "..."}` seed rows left over from `task.py create` before the curator ran).
3. Read the task's `prd.md` (requirements), then `design.md` if present (technical design), then `implement.md` if present (execution plan).

If `{{JSONL_FILE}}` has no curated entries (only a seed row, or the file is missing), fall back to: read the task artifacts, list available specs with `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode packages`, and pick the specs that match the task domain yourself. Do NOT block on the missing jsonl — lightweight tasks may be PRD-only, while complex tasks may also include `design.md` and `implement.md`.

If the resolved task path has no `prd.md`, ask the user what to work on; do NOT proceed without context.
